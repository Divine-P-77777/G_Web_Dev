// ðŸŒŸ What is an Event in JavaScript?
// An event is something that happens in the browser.

// Examples:

// Clicking a button

// Typing in a text box

// Moving your mouse

// Submitting a form

// Resizing the window

// When these things happen, we say an event has occurred, and JavaScript can react to those events.


// | Property             | Description                                                |

// | `type`               | The type of event (e.g., `'click'`, `'keydown'`)           |
// | `target`             | The HTML element where the event happened                  |
// | `currentTarget`      | The element the event listener was attached to             |
// | `clientX`, `clientY` | The mouse position when the event occurred                 |
// | `key`                | The key pressed during a keyboard event                    |
// | `preventDefault()`   | Prevents the default browser action (like form submission) |
// | `stopPropagation()`  | Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements        |
